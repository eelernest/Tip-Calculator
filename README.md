## My process

- 1.First I analyzed the base design, I made a sketch of how it could work. I started to layout with html until I got the structure
- 2.Use bootstrap-class to make it responsive
- 3.Finally work on the application logic. I put events to the buttons, I did 3 functions.
  - The first to execute the calculation
  - The second to mark an error with the number of people
  - The third to validate the calculation and return it to the screen


### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JS
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

I put into practice my knowledge as a web developer, use JS to call events on inputs and buttons.
It was really frustrating for me to make the logic of the app, however I learned a lot by making variants and reducing my code.


### Continued development


I'm making devs web with javascript to practice and develop my programming logic and web design, in addition to practicing the front-end knowledge.

I feel my progress as I go!
